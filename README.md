# Phenomenon Ontology (PhenOWL)

Welcome to the Phenomenon Ontology repository! This project aims to create an ontology for describing objects and events related to phenomena, including their spatio-temporal characteristics.

## Summary

The Phenomenon Ontology project focuses on developing a comprehensive ontology that enables the description and representation of various phenomena. By leveraging ontological concepts and standards, we aim to provide a structured framework for capturing the essence of phenomena and their associated attributes.

## Installation

To use the Phenomenon Ontology, you just need to clone the repository with:

  `git clone https://github.com/Gabriel382/PhenOWL.git`

## Usage

Once you have completed the installation, you can start using the Phenomenon Ontology by following these steps:

1. Open the ontology file in your preferred ontology editor (e.g., [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/)).
2. Explore the ontology structure and concepts.
3. Use the ontology to describe objects, events, and their spatio-temporal characteristics related to phenomena.
4. Integrate the Phenomenon Ontology into your own projects or systems.
5. Have fun!

## Ontologies Used

The Phenomenon Ontology relies on the following ontologies:

1. **Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO)**: A foundational ontology that provides a rich set of top-level categories and relationships for building domain-specific ontologies.

2. **GeoSparql**: An ontology for representing and querying geospatial data, enabling the description of spatial features and relationships within the Phenomenon Ontology.

3. **OWL-Time**: An ontology for representing temporal entities and relationships, allowing the description of temporal characteristics within the Phenomenon Ontology.
