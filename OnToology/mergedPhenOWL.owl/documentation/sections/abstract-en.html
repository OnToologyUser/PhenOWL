<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The Core Propagation Phenomenon Ontology (PhenOWL) is designed to represent the propagation of any phenomenon in a network, leveraging the spatiotemporal characteristics of propagation from different observation points, with the participation of multiple entities in the process. This ontology will be used in the future in a broader framework for describing, detecting, and predicting the spread of health risks in a network based on heterogeneous textual data.</span>
